                    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                    <p>For more than 80 years, St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center has been dedicated to helping animals in need, regardless of species, size, or temperament. With a people-focused, community-based approach, we treat every animal as an individual and emphasize specialized care for both animals and their families.

                        St. Hubert's supports New Jersey communities with programs that help animals stay with their families, such as pet food banks, vaccine clinics and emergency pet boarding.
                        
                        Through our merger with the Humane Rescue Alliance in Washington, D.C., we are the largest provider of animal services in our region, touching the lives of tens of thousands of animals each year.
                        
                        Our WayStation program is the nation's preeminent transport program and has moved over 20,000 pets from areas of need to places of opportunity through a network of more than 90 sheltering organizations. Through our Give Back program, we have invested more than $350,000 back into our source shelter partners whose communities are often struggling under the weight of pet overpopulation so that they can address the root causes in their own community, based on their unique needs.</p>

                    <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
                    <p>In 1870, the Humane Rescue Alliance (then operating as Washington Humane Society) was charged by a congressional charter to protect the children and animals of the District of Columbia, creating the foundation for the organization’s law enforcement work and its pursuit of preventing animal cruelty in the District. HRA remains the only congressionally-chartered animal welfare organization in the country. 

                        HRA has over 150 years of experience serving our communities, including conducting cruelty investigations, providing animal control services, and advocating for federal, state and local legislation and policies that protect animals. 
                        
                        HRA serves as a national leader and local champion for animals. We assist our communities by helping them search for new companions, secure financial assistance for veterinary care or pet food, provide guidance with behavioral problems, and increase access to services to keep families together with their pets. 
                        
                        The Humane Rescue Alliance leverages the unique strengths of its legacy organizations, the Washington Humane Society, The Washington Animal Rescue League and St. Hubert’s Animal Welfare Center, to grow families through adoption, protect animals from harm, and provide programs and resources so people and pets can stay together. Our collective expands our reach and allows us to accomplish more for the animals we care for and the communities we serve. Together, we support families and advocate for positive change to create a world where all animals can thrive.
